Home Work 2 -- JAVA File Program -- Due 8/7/2014 9:00 PM
------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: N/A

NOTE: 
1) Program should run on a sample.txt file and display results
2) Save your  java projects in this directory:
    c:\git_projects\pgdev\gow_Java\homework_solutions

YOU COMPLETED THIS STEP ALREADY - Make sure all the punctuation are avoided
I) Write a Java program that reads a file "sample.txt" which has several lines of text in it. 
The program should print the list of all the unique words in the text along with the number of times each word appears.

II) For today, you will expand on the above program to do the following:

1) for any large text inside sample.txt, print top 10 most used words (Note, punctuation and case should be ignored)
2) You should exclude 100 most common words used in english language, listed in this page:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English
Note: you can create another text file with the above words to read in the file into another array / table

Example:
Copy and paste any  text from internet / news in to a sample.txt file


This program can be used to quickly tell what the news is generally talking about. Good luck
